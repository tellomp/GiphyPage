# GiphyPage

### Overview 
* A dynamic web page that populates with marvel characters using the GIPHY API. I called the GIPHY API and used JavaScript and jQuery to change the site's HTML.
* An array of superhero characters was created and the app takes the topics and creates buttons in the HTML.

* When the user clicks on a character button, the page grabs 10 static gifs with thier rating from the GIPHY API and places them on the page. 
* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.
* User is able to add a character button which will then be added to the array, display a button in the HTML, and populate the page with gifs for that character.
